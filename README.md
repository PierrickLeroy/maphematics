#### :world_map: A map of mathematics with relations, subfields and contributors.
Mathematics is an essential and fundamental subject that plays a crucial role in our daily lives but is rarely apparent. A lot of the "magic" happens offstage in technology, economics, games or engineering, mathematics are at the same time discreet and ubiquitous. It takes is a curious eye to see through this first veil. Once this first step has been made however, it is easy to get lost in the land of mathematical concepts, hence the need of a map of mathematics.

Understanding the origin of mathematical concepts is not only interesting but also useful. Firstly, it allows us to appreciate the richness and diversity of mathematics. By studying the historical development of mathematical ideas, we can gain insight into the cultural, social, and scientific contexts in which they emerged. This can help us better understand the significance and impact of mathematical ideas. It can also help us develop a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the subject. By tracing the historical development of a concept, we can see how it evolved, and how it relates to other mathematical ideas. This can help us build more robust mental models of mathematical concepts, and develop a more flexible and adaptable approach.

#### :computer: Software
The map is built using  [Xmind](https://xmind.app/download/ "Xmind download page"). This choice is motivated by the fact that Xmind is reliable and well suited for collaboration : it is supported on all major OS, super easy to handle and has all the most important features desirable for a mind-map in its free version.
